### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
#### My name is Noah Smith. I'm an up and coming software developer with the skills and confidence to succeed. I specialize in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I have a great passion for technology, and I have a strong history of IT and customer service in addition to software development. I have been using computers every since I was a young child and have always dreamed of using them to create something special. Now I'd like to use my skills as a software developer to do that for you!

#### You can reach me at [my email address](mailto:noahcsmith1993@gmail.com) if you'd like to contact me. My inbox is always open!
